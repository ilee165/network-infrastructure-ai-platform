"""Sandboxed tshark invocation (M5; ADR-0023 §1 — the critical containment).

A pcap is **untrusted input** and tshark's C dissectors carry parsing CVEs, so
running tshark over an attacker-influenced file is the single most dangerous
operation in the platform. This module is the only place that spawns tshark, and
it does so under the concrete sandbox controls ADR-0023 §1 mandates:

- **argv list, never a shell** — :func:`build_tshark_argv` returns a ``list[str]``
  passed to ``subprocess.run`` with ``shell=False`` (the default). The pcap path
  and any display filter are *argv elements*, never interpolated into a command
  string, so a filename like ``"; rm -rf / #"`` or a filter containing shell
  metacharacters cannot be executed — they are inert data to the child.
- **filter whitelist** — any display filter is validated by
  :func:`app.engines.packet.filters.validate_capture_filter` *before* the argv is
  built; a rejected filter raises and no process is spawned.
- **no name resolution** — ``-n`` is always passed, so dissection performs no
  DNS/host/port lookups (no egress is triggered by analysis).
- **hard subprocess timeout** — the tshark child is bounded by
  ``settings.packet_analysis_timeout_seconds``; an oversized/slow/hostile capture
  fails the task (``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` → :class:`SandboxError`) rather
  than wedging the worker.

The OS-level controls (no-network container, dropped capabilities, non-root,
read-only pcap mount, CPU/memory limits) are the deployment's responsibility
(Compose/K8s, ADR-0023 §1) — this module enforces the *process-launch* controls
that live in code and is the layer the unit tests pin (argv-not-shell, ``-n``
present, filter validated, timeout honored).

**Executor-split dispatch (ADR-0049).** :func:`analyze_pcap` still runs tshark
*in-process* and is kept as (a) the enforcement-off fallback the executor child
uses on a non-Linux/dev host and (b) the synchronous API analyzer's path. The
deployed Celery ``packet.analyze_capture`` path no longer parses pcap bytes here:
:func:`run_executor` is the **dispatcher** half of the split — it spawns a
short-lived, self-confining ``python -m app.engines.packet.executor`` child, reaps
it (SIGKILLing the whole process group on timeout so no wedged/popped tshark
grandchild survives — ADR-0049 blocker 4), and validates the child's stdout into a
bounded :class:`PacketFindings` (marshalling), so the dispatcher only ever handles
small, schema-shaped findings and never ``json.loads`` raw tshark output.
